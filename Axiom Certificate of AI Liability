💼 How to "Sell" Tier 3 to the Board
When you present this to the Board, you don't talk about "code." You talk about Risk Transfer.

The Argument: "Right now, your AI is a black box. If it hallucinates and gives bad medical or financial advice, the company is 100% liable. By using the Axiom Wrapper, we move that risk from 'Unknown' to 'Monitored and Insured.'"

The "Safety" Feature: Give them a Quarterly Governance PDF. It summarizes all the technical wins from the Devs and PMs into 3 pages of charts that a lawyer or insurance broker can understand.
