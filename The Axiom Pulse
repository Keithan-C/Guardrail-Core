🖥️ The Axiom Pulse: Dashboard Layout
The dashboard should be divided into three "High-Glance" sections.

1. The Global Health Score (The "Peace of Mind" Metric)

At the top, a large, color-coded radial gauge shows the overall compliance percentage across all AI features.

98% Compliant: (Green) Everything is within the parameters defined in the compliance.json.

85% Warning: (Yellow) Minor toxicity spikes or missing PII scrubbing on a new beta feature.

<70% Critical: (Red) A model is hallucinating or leaking data. The "SafeSwitch" has been triggered.

2. Live "Drift" Monitoring

A real-time feed showing how the AI is performing against the Guardrails set in Tier 1.

PII Interceptions: "14 attempted data leaks blocked today."

Toxicity Level: "Avg. 0.02 (Limit: 0.10)."

Hallucination Rate: "0.5% (Based on 1,000 queries)."

3. Feature-by-Feature Breakdown (Table View)

This is where the PM manages different product units.

Feature Name	Status	Last Audit	Risk Level
Customer Support Bot	✅ Passing	2 mins ago	Low
Sales Copilot	⚠️ Warning	1 hour ago	Medium (Bias detected)
Internal HR Search	✅ Passing	10 mins ago	Low
🛠️ The "Value" Features for the PM
To make this indispensable for a PM, include these "one-click" actions:

The "Generate Audit Report" Button: Instantly exports a PDF that maps all Tier 1 logs to a specific regulation (like the EU AI Act or HIPAA). This saves the PM weeks of manual documentation.

The "Safety Valve" Toggle: A physical button on the dashboard that allows the PM to "Kill" a specific AI feature if the toxicity levels spike, without needing to ask a developer to push code.

The "Liability Link": A direct connection to Tier 3. It shows how many "Safe Hours" have been logged, which directly justifies the insurance certification for the Board.

💡 How it works in the "Wrapper"
Every time a developer uses your Tier 1 SDK, it sends a heartbeat to this dashboard.

Dev pushes code -> Axiom checks the schema.

Model runs -> Axiom intercepts the data.

Dashboard updates -> PM sees the "Pulse" in real-time.
